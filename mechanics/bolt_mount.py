class BoltMount:

    def __init__(self, workplane, measures):
        """
        A parametric mount for captured hex bolts to flat surfaces.

        This can be used for several purposes, including as a generic system of support studs for 
        mounting units inside machines and electronic devices to the case walls.

        :param workplane: The CadQuery workplane to create this part on.
        :param measures: The measures to use for the parameters of this design. Expects a nested 
            [SimpleNamespace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) 
            object, which may have the following attributes:
            - **``block.width``:** Width of the mount's cuboid base shape.
            - **``block.height``:** Height of the mount's cuboid base shape.
            - **``block.depth``:** Depth of the mount's cuboid base shape.
            - **``hole.diameter``:** Diameter of the hole for the bolt to be mounted.
            - **``hole.head_depth``:** Longitudinal space for the captured bolt head.
            - **``hole.head_across_flats``:** Radial space for the captured bolt head, specified 
                as the "nut size" of that space. Should be minimally larger than the nut size of the 
                captured hexagonal bolt head.
            - **``brackets.positions``:** Where to create mount brackets around the main cuboid 
                shape. A SimpleNamespace objects with booleans values "left", "right", "top", "bottom".
            - **``brackets.height``:** Local height of an individual support bracket.
            - **``brackets.thickness``:** Thickness of an individual support bracket.
            - **``brackets.hole_count``:** Number of holes per support bracket.
            - **``brackets.hole_diameter``:** Diameter of the holes in the support brackets.
            - **``brackets.fillet_radius``:** Radius of the reinforcing fillet along the bracketed edge.

        .. todo:: Adjust the hole positioning to be suitable for high brackets.
        .. todo:: Place the bracket holes only into the non-filleted portion of the bracket.
        .. todo:: Adjust the positioning so that the mounted bolt is positioned upside-down on the 
            XY plane. That would be the natural orientation for a generic bolt mount.
        .. todo:: Allow configurations for each of the attached brackets individually, with 
            parameters for width and offet from the center of the core edge (plus or minus).
        .. todo:: Allow the bolt hole to go through the block at any angle, for cases when 
            the angle of the mounted bolt should not be simply 90Â°.
